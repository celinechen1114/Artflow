# Project Description:
Our website addresses a recognized pain point - the complexity of existing digital art applications. 
To make the creative process enjoyable and accessible for everyone, we've created a user-friendly interface with a wide selection of captivating filters inspired by popular trends and artistic styles. 
Additionally, we've included an interactive tutorial that guides users through the app's tools and features, ensuring they can fully unleash their creativity.
With our simple and engaging platform, users can effortlessly apply Instagram-like filters to their digital drawings, transforming them into mesmerizing works of art. 
Let your imagination soar as you explore the world of digital art with ease and excitement.

# Reflection:
Our efforts yielded the successful implementation of most features proposed in the initial prototype. 
While the interface might not have attained the desired level of minimalism, it functionally met almost all our objectives. 
Among the features we've developed, we take the most pride in the versatile filters. 
Our guiding principle was a user-friendly interface supplemented with an instructive tutorial, and a filter function aimed at stimulating fresh perspectives on artists' creations. 
There were some features that were far too complicated to implement, such as layer management. 
However, upon reflecting on our journey, it's gratifying to realize that we have indeed realized most of our intended vision.
