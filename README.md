# Artflow üé®üåü
Artflow is an innovative digital art application designed to simplify the creative process. Our user-friendly interface, combined with a wide range of captivating filters and an interactive tutorial, makes digital art accessible and enjoyable for everyone. 

I primarily focused on the design aspects of our project, which included creating initial low-fidelity sketches, wireframing, and developing Figma prototypes. My team partner, Bernie, and I worked collaboratively on several key aspects. Together, we constructed a hierarchical task analysis and delved into understanding the challenges associated with creativity support tools. We also conducted a thorough task analysis and designed an interview protocol to gather user insights effectively. Additionally, we jointly applied our skills in implementing front-end programming techniques and responsive design, including the integration of touch gestures.
